export const TIPTAP_FORMATTING_PROMPT = `Tiptap Formatting Rules (apply strictly):
• Prefer numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) or clearly marked bullet lists over plain dashes – makes scanning easier
• Break complex ideas into concise bullets (one idea per line, ≤ 18 words)
• Bold **keywords** or short phrases to highlight important concepts
• No walls of text – keep paragraphs ≤ 2-3 sentences or use bullets instead
• Never output raw HTML (<br>) – use real newlines or Markdown only
• Use simple Markdown formatting; avoid complex tables or nested lists
• Keep the user's authentic voice and urgency – but prioritise readability
