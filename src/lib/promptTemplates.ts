export const TIPTAP_FORMATTING_PROMPT = `Markdown Formatting Rules (apply strictly):
â€¢ OUTPUT CLEAN MARKDOWN - not plain text, not HTML, not JSON
â€¢ Prefer numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) or bullet lists (- item) for easy scanning
â€¢ Break complex ideas into concise bullets (one idea per line, â‰¤ 18 words)
â€¢ Bold **keywords** or short phrases to highlight important concepts
â€¢ Use ## headings for major sections, ### for subsections (but avoid excessive nesting)
â€¢ No walls of text â€“ keep paragraphs â‰¤ 2-3 sentences or use bullets instead
â€¢ Never output raw HTML tags like <br> â€“ use real line breaks or Markdown only
â€¢ Use simple Markdown: **bold**, *italic*, - bullets, 1. numbers, ## headings
â€¢ Keep the user's authentic voice and urgency â€“ but prioritise readability
â€¢ Double line breaks for paragraph separation, single line breaks within lists
`

export const ULTRA_CONDENSED_ORGANIZATION_TEMPLATE = `CONDENSED CONTENT RULES:
â€¢ NO explanations, introductions, or overviews
â€¢ NO "This section covers..." or "Overview:" text
â€¢ NO repetitive content or fluff
â€¢ DIRECT content with brief context - each item on its own line with proper line breaks
â€¢ **PRIORITIZE NUMBERED LISTS (1. 2. 3.) over bullet points** - better for tasks and priorities
â€¢ Keep original voice and urgency
â€¢ 5-10 words per bullet point (brief but clear)
â€¢ NO corporate speak - write like personal notes
â€¢ Focus on WHAT needs to be done with minimal context
â€¢ CRITICAL: Use proper line breaks between items, not all on one line

PREFERRED FORMAT (numbered):
1. Fix login bug in auth system
2. Call client about project timeline  
3. Update API documentation
4. Deploy bug fixes to production

ALTERNATIVE FORMAT (bullets):
- Fix login bug in auth system
- Call client about project timeline

BAD FORMAT:
TODO: 1. Fix bug 2. Call client 3. Update docs (all on one line - NO!)

export const ANTI_NEW_FILE_CREATION_RULES = `ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: AVOID CREATING NEW FILES AT ALL COSTS!
â€¢ If content has already been routed to existing files, it's EXTREMELY UNLIKELY you need to create a new file
â€¢ ALWAYS use existing files first - they exist for a reason
â€¢ Only create new files if content is 100% unique and fits nowhere else
â€¢ When in doubt, USE AN EXISTING FILE rather than create new one
â€¢ Write FULL FILE PATHS (like "/Project Notes/Sprint Planning") to avoid creating accidental new notes
â€¢ Partial paths create unwanted new files - ALWAYS use complete paths from file tree

ROUTING PRIORITY:
1. FIRST: Try existing files (even if not perfect match)
2. SECOND: Use broader existing categories  
3. LAST RESORT: Create new file (almost never needed)
`

export const MULTIPLE_DESTINATIONS_STRATEGY = `MULTIPLE DESTINATIONS STRATEGY:
â€¢ Same content can appear in multiple files (Project Notes, Bug Tracker, Daily Tasks, etc.) but its SUPER rare.
â€¢ If content fits 3 files very very well, create 3 separate JSON objects with same content. But doing things like putting TODOs in ideas is just stupid and wrong.
`

export const MARKDOWN_OUTPUT_RULES = `OUTPUT FORMATTING:
â€¢ Content = PROPER MARKDOWN with line breaks between items
â€¢ **PRIORITIZE NUMBERED LISTS (1. 2. 3.) over bullet points** - better for tasks and priorities
â€¢ Keep original urgency/tone
â€¢ Normal file names with spaces (no .md, no kebab-case)
â€¢ REPEAT the same content across multiple files if it's relevant to multiple places
`

export const EDITING_USER_CONTENT_FOR_ORGANIZATION = `SMART ORGANIZATION RULES (concise & context):

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
â€¢ Write like crisp personal notes â€“ no corporate fluff, no filler.
â€¢ Preserve the user's own words/energy.
â€¢ Bullet/paragraph â‰¤ 15 words when possible.
â€¢ Give a brief **why** (1 short sentence) after each key conclusion.
â€¢ Use markdown headings (##) and **bold** to structure & highlight.
â€¢ Choose format by content type:
  â€“ Thinking / Reflection â†’ "## Key Conclusions" then bullets (**idea** â€“ why it matters).
  â€“ TODOs â†’ Numbered list 1. 2. 3. (some context on the todo, â‰¤10 words).
  â€“ Learnings / Book notes â†’ bullets: quote (if any) + takeaway (â‰¤2 sentences).
â€¢ Separate sections with a blank line.
â€¢ Keep all meaningful detail; just condense & group logically.

EXAMPLES
THINKING (BAD)
The second brain is useless.

THINKING (GOOD)
## Key Conclusions

**Second brain must surface relevance** â€“ Only useful when notes appear exactly when needed.

TODO LIST (GOOD)
1. **Fix login bug**
2. Call client about project timeline

LEARNINGS (GOOD)
### Atomic Habits â€“ James Clear
> "You do not rise to the level of your goals..."
**Systems over goals** â€“ Daily systems compound to large outcomes.
