export const TIPTAP_FORMATTING_PROMPT = `Markdown Formatting Rules (apply strictly):
â€¢ OUTPUT CLEAN MARKDOWN - not plain text, not HTML, not JSON
â€¢ Prefer numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) or bullet lists (- item) for easy scanning
â€¢ Break complex ideas into concise bullets (one idea per line, â‰¤ 18 words)
â€¢ Bold **keywords** or short phrases to highlight important concepts
â€¢ Use ## headings for major sections, ### for subsections (but avoid excessive nesting)
â€¢ No walls of text â€“ keep paragraphs â‰¤ 2-3 sentences or use bullets instead
â€¢ Never output raw HTML tags like <br> â€“ use real line breaks or Markdown only
â€¢ Use simple Markdown: **bold**, *italic*, - bullets, 1. numbers, ## headings
â€¢ Keep the user's authentic voice and urgency â€“ but prioritise readability
â€¢ Double line breaks for paragraph separation, single line breaks within lists
`

export const ULTRA_CONDENSED_ORGANIZATION_TEMPLATE = `CONDENSED CONTENT RULES:
â€¢ NO explanations, introductions, or overviews
â€¢ NO "This section covers..." or "Overview:" text
â€¢ NO repetitive content or fluff
â€¢ DIRECT content with brief context - each item on its own line with proper line breaks
â€¢ **PRIORITIZE NUMBERED LISTS (1. 2. 3.) over bullet points** - better for tasks and priorities
â€¢ Keep original voice and urgency
â€¢ 5-10 words per bullet point (brief but clear)
â€¢ NO corporate speak - write like personal notes
â€¢ Focus on WHAT needs to be done with minimal context
â€¢ CRITICAL: Use proper line breaks between items, not all on one line

PREFERRED FORMAT (numbered):
1. Fix login bug in auth system
2. Call client about project timeline  
3. Update API documentation
4. Deploy bug fixes to production

ALTERNATIVE FORMAT (bullets):
- Fix login bug in auth system
- Call client about project timeline

BAD FORMAT:
TODO: 1. Fix bug 2. Call client 3. Update docs (all on one line - NO!)

export const ANTI_NEW_FILE_CREATION_RULES = `ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: AVOID CREATING NEW FILES AT ALL COSTS!
â€¢ If content has already been routed to existing files, it's EXTREMELY UNLIKELY you need to create a new file
â€¢ ALWAYS use existing files first - they exist for a reason
â€¢ Only create new files if content is 100% unique and fits nowhere else
â€¢ When in doubt, USE AN EXISTING FILE rather than create new one
â€¢ Write FULL FILE PATHS (like "/Project Notes/Sprint Planning") to avoid creating accidental new notes
â€¢ Partial paths create unwanted new files - ALWAYS use complete paths from file tree

ROUTING PRIORITY:
1. FIRST: Try existing files (even if not perfect match)
2. SECOND: Use broader existing categories  
3. LAST RESORT: Create new file (almost never needed)
`

export const MULTIPLE_DESTINATIONS_STRATEGY = `MULTIPLE DESTINATIONS STRATEGY:
â€¢ Same content can appear in multiple files (Project Notes, Bug Tracker, Daily Tasks, etc.) but its SUPER rare.
â€¢ If content fits 3 files very very well, create 3 separate JSON objects with same content. But doing things like putting TODOs in ideas is just stupid and wrong.
`

export const MARKDOWN_OUTPUT_RULES = `OUTPUT FORMATTING:
â€¢ Content = PROPER MARKDOWN with line breaks between items
â€¢ **PRIORITIZE NUMBERED LISTS (1. 2. 3.) over bullet points** - better for tasks and priorities
â€¢ Keep original urgency/tone
â€¢ Normal file names with spaces (no .md, no kebab-case)
â€¢ REPEAT the same content across multiple files if it's relevant to multiple places
`

export const EDITING_USER_CONTENT_FOR_ORGANIZATION = `CONTENT EDITING GUIDELINES:
â€¢ **PRESERVE the user's authentic language, tone, and voice** - don't rewrite their words
â€¢ **GROUP related ideas together** under clear headings or sections
â€¢ **Use bullet points and numbered lists** to break up walls of text
â€¢ **Keep ALL important information** - don't cut out details, just organize them better
â€¢ **Add structure with markdown headings** (## and ###) to create scannable sections
â€¢ **Bold key terms and important points** for quick scanning
â€¢ **Break long paragraphs** into shorter, digestible chunks
â€¢ **Maintain the user's urgency and emotion** - if they wrote "URGENT!" keep that energy
â€¢ **Combine similar ideas** - group related thoughts together logically
â€¢ **Keep original urgency/tone** - preserve the user's emotional context
â€¢ **ADD CONTEXT AND EXPLANATIONS** - single-line bullets with no explanation are useless
â€¢ **EXPLAIN WHY things matter** - add 1-2 sentences of context for each main point
â€¢ **PROVIDE DETAILS** - don't just list items, explain what they mean or why they're important
â€¢ **Focus on organization AND explanation** - make it both scannable and informative

EXAMPLES:
BAD: "Second brain delivers relevant content only" (no context, no explanation)
GOOD: "## Second Brain Principles\n\n**Relevant Content Delivery**: The second brain should filter and surface only the most relevant information for your current context and goals. This reduces cognitive load by eliminating noise and helping you focus on what matters most for your immediate tasks.\n\n**High Surface Ingestion**: Design your system to capture information quickly and effortlessly, so you don't lose important insights in the moment."

BAD: "Fix login bug" (too brief, no context)
GOOD: "1. **Fix login authentication bug** - Users are getting 401 errors when trying to log in with valid credentials. This is blocking new user signups and affecting customer satisfaction."
